# Description
Pick and place robots are widely used in industry specifically in assembly plants and manufacturing. These robots virtually eliminate human error and can run continuously with minor supervision. The system is composed of a dc motor; the motor is connected to a truss structure designed and fabricated earlier to form a simple robotic system conducting a pick and place operation. A payload is attached to the end of the beam using a solenoid. If the magnet is on, the disk will stick to the beam, and when the magnet is turned off, the disk is released.

# Objectives
* pick up and place a metal object attached to a robot arm by an electromagnet from position 0° to a specified angular position with a specified overshoot and minimum overall time (the hole location may be anywhere within an angular range of 20° to 180° from the initial position)
* the arm may not overshoot the desired position by more than 5°
* a tolerance of ±2% is acceptable (settling time).
* develop a controller that allows for the Robot arm to go from start to end position as fast as possible while meeting all design criteria
